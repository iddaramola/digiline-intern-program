# Fullstack Frontend Internship Repository

Welcome! This repository contains a 12-week internship roadmap.

## 📌 Purpose
This repo helps you learn frontend fundamentals step by step.

- Each week has its own folder: `week-01`, `week-02`, etc.
- Inside each week’s folder:
  - `README.md` — overview of the week’s focus.
  - `tasks.md` — checklist of what you need to build.
  - Starter code — HTML/CSS/JS files to help you begin.

## 📁 Structure
```
/week-01/
  README.md
  tasks.md
  index.html
  /assets/

/week-02/
  ...
```

## ✅ How to use
- Pick your week’s folder.
- Read the `README.md` and `tasks.md`.
- Use the starter code as your base.
- Push your changes via PRs.

## 🔗 Branches
- Each week has a protected branch (`week-01`, `week-02`).
- You must create a feature branch off it (e.g., `week-01-dev`).
- Open a PR into the week branch.

Happy building 🚀!
