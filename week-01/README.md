## 📖 What to Learn

Before you start coding, read and understand these concepts:

### 🌐 How the Web Works
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** How domain names like `google.com` translate to IP addresses.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** How browsers and servers communicate to send and receive web pages.
- **Browser Rendering:** How browsers read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a page.

### 🗂️ HTML Basics
- **Semantic HTML:** Using tags that describe the meaning of content (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- **Form Structure:** How to build accessible forms using `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and the `for` attribute.

### 🎨 Responsive Design Basics
- **Mobile-first thinking:** Design for smaller screens first, then enhance for larger screens.
- **Basic CSS Media Queries:** Use CSS to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.
- **Flexbox/Grid (Optional, basic):** Simple ways to arrange sections side by side or stacked.
